## API

### Data Types

#### Auth

Media Type: `application/vnd.expensapp.auth+json`

```javascript
{
    user: not-nil,
    password: optional // client should send, server never will
}
```

#### Expense

Media Type: `application/vnd.expensapp.expense+json`

```
{
    datetime: not-nil,
    description: not-nil,
    amount: not-nil,
    comment:not-nil,
    location: optional // will be set by the server, not required on POSTs
}
```

#### Expenses

Media Type: `application/vnd.expensapp.expenses+json`

Expenses are a collection of `Expense` objects.

```javascript
[
    { expense_1 },
    { expense_2 },
    ...
    { expense_n}
]
```

Contract:
- No expenses will be represented by an empty array
- The array will not be ordered.
- The latest expense date will be no more than one week after the earliest

## Using Expensapp

### Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

And the latest [node][2] for web dependencies (via npm)

[2]: http://nodejs.org/download/

### Starting

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

### Building

To build an executable jar, run:

    lein ring uberjar

This will create a jar in the target directory named with the format `expensapp-$version-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

The current $version is `0.1.0`


### Testing
